# PasswordManager
> A Chromium extension that gets site account data stored on a pre-defined json-file. Used for filling passwordfields.

## Notes
- Extension works, when loaded as unpacked to a browser.
- Gets page's account data from pre-defined json-file, which is displayed in a browser pop-up.
- Angular application is for creating, storing, and encrypting password data. (None of these have been implemented, yet)
- Current json is a place-holder. Does not encrypt accountdata, yet. DO NOT USE!
